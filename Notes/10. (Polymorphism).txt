-> POLYMORPHISM
Means Many forms. Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. 
We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. 
This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
