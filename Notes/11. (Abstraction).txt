-> ABSTRACTION
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
Example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).

Ways to achieve Abstraction:
There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
(i)Abstract class (0 to 100%)
(ii)Interface (100%)

The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:
(1) ABSTRACT CLASS: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
*A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
*It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.
*An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
*It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
*It cannot be instantiated.
*It can have constructors and static methods also.
*It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.

Syntax: abstract class A{}  

(2) ABSTRACT METHOD: A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.
Syntax: abstract void printStatus();   //no method body and abstract
