Constructors in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.
Constructor is called when the object is created.
It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class.

// Create a Main class
public class Main {
  int x;  // Create a class attribute

  // Create a class constructor for the Main class
  public Main() {
    x = 5;  // Set the initial value for the class attribute x
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of class Main (This will call the constructor)
    System.out.println(myObj.x); // Print the value of x
  }
}

Note: The constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void).

-> Constructor Types
(i) Default Constructor: A constructor is called "Default Constructor" when it doesn't have any parameter.
(ii) Parameterized Constructor: A constructor which has a specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
